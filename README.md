## What is BRRTRouter?

**BRRTRouter** generates a complete, type-safe HTTP server from your OpenAPI specification. Write your API definition once, get routing, validation, middleware, observability, and handler scaffolding automatically. Ship production-ready APIs faster.

Inspired by the *GAU-8/A Avenger* on the A-10 Warthog, this router delivers precision request dispatch with massive throughput. Built on `may` coroutines for lightweight concurrency (800+ concurrent connections), it's designed for developers who want OpenAPI-first development without sacrificing performance.

## 🎯 Why BRRTRouter?


| Traditional Approach                    | BRRTRouter                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write routes manually for each endpoint | Generated from OpenAPI spec                                                                       |
| Add validation per endpoint             | Automatic from JSON Schema                                                                        |
| Configure observability stack           | Built-in, zero config (Prometheus, Jaeger, Loki)                                                  |
| Build admin/testing UI                  | Included (Sample SolidJS dashboard)                                                               |

| **Fix flaky tests / deterministic startup**      | ✅      | Tests use a fixed sleep to wait for server readiness and cancel the coroutine abruptly.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Investigate config context**                   | ✅      | A pragmatic way to pass Configuration across the entire code base, possibly with an immutable global config that is loaded at start time                                                                                                                                     |
| **Panic recovery for handlers**                  | ✅      | Un-typed handlers recover from panics using `catch_unwind`; typed handlers do not.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Comprehensive logging/tracing**                | ✅      | Structured tracing with 49 runtime touchpoints across request lifecycle, routing, security, validation, dispatcher, handlers, and hot reload; JSON format with redaction, sampling, async buffering; dual output (stdout + Loki) for hot reload                              |
| **Multiple security providers**                  | ✅      | Multiple providers supported and auto-registered from OpenAPI schemes; per-route scheme enforcement tested; supports ApiKey, Bearer, OAuth2, JWKS, RemoteApiKey                                                                                                              |
| **Code generation for typed handlers**           | ✅      | Complete template system generates `TryFrom<HandlerRequest>` impls, Request/Response structs with serde annotations; production-ready                                                                                                                                        |
| **BFF Auto-Proxy Core Integration**              | ✅      | Fully bypasses macro implementations for pure proxies; suppresses generating unneeded endpoints in downstream schemas; utilizes native `may_http` connection caching to reach theoretical target 85k req/sec throughput logic                                                |
| **Dynamic route registration**                   | ✅      | `Dispatcher::add_route` and `register_from_spec` working; used in production; tests cover this functionality                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Structured tracing (OTEL)**                    | ✅      | OpenTelemetry tracing implemented with test support; integrated with Jaeger in Tilt environment                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Configurable stack size with instrumentation** | ✅      | Stack size comes from `BRRTR_STACK_SIZE` environment variable and is logged in metrics; no runtime API or used-stack metrics.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Hot reload on spec change**                    | ✅      | `hot_reload::watch_spec` rebuilds the `Router`, the server automatically updates the dispatcher and registers new routes.                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Extend fake otel collector across all tests**  | 🚧     | Fake OpenTelemetry collector is used in just tests, but not all tests utilize it.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **handler coroutine stack size**                 | 🚧     | Coroutine stack size is set via `BRRTR_STACK_SIZE` env var, but not dynamically adjustable or measured.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Deep dive into OpenAPI spec**                  | 🚧     | OpenAPI spec parsing is basic; does not handle all features like `callbacks` and other functions. See [OPENAPI_3.1.0_COMPLIANCE_GAP.md](OPENAPI_3.1.0_COMPLIANCE_GAP.md) for the gap analysis and path to full OpenAPI 3.1.0 support.                                        |
| **WebSocket support**                            | 🚧     | Not implemented. Only SSE is available via `x-sse` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Documentation & packaging**                    | 🚧     | README and roadmap exist; crate not yet prepared for crates.io publication.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## 📊 Performance & Scale-Out Strategy

BRRTRouter is engineered for **cloud-native scale-out** rather than monolithic scale-up architectures. To guarantee high availability and stability, the system aggressively bounds heap constraints.

**Capacity Targets per Pod:**

- **2,000 concurrent users** handling up to **20,000 req/s**.
- **Fail-fast shedding:** Built-in queue bounded protection forces `503 Service Unavailable` caps during excessive load spikes. This intentionally triggers cloud-native infrastructure (like Kubernetes HPA) to scale out horizontally rather than allowing unbounded memory growth to crash the pod natively.
- **Real-world Latencies:** Standard routing prior to implementing business logic sees responses around **~15ms**, while production endpoints involving data reads/writes average **~200ms to 400ms** depending on complexity.

See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for complete benchmarks, load test results, and optimization details.

## 🛡️ JSF AV Rules Compliance

BRRTRouter implements coding standards inspired by the **[Joint Strike Fighter Air Vehicle C++ Coding Standards](https://www.stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf)** (JSF AV Rules) — the same rigorous standards used in the F-35 fighter jet's flight-critical software.

**Key principles:**

- **Zero allocations** in hot path (SmallVec for params/headers)
- **O(k) radix tree** routing for predictable latency
- **Result-based** error handling (no panics in dispatch)
- **Stack-allocated** collections (JSF Rule 206)

**Results:** 81,407 req/s peak load potential, 15ms latency without business logic, ~200-400ms with business logic.

See [docs/JSF_COMPLIANCE.md](docs/JSF_COMPLIANCE.md) for complete implementation details and validation results.
