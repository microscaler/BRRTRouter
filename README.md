# BRRTRouter

**BRRTRouter** is a high-performance, coroutine-powered request router for Rust, driven entirely by an [OpenAPI 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) specification.

Inspired by the *GAU-8/A Avenger* on the A-10 Warthog, this router is designed to deliver precision request dispatch with massive throughput and low overhead.

## üìà Recent Progress (Sep 2025)

- **JWT/JWKS validation fix**: `JwksBearerProvider` now respects the JWT header `alg` and supports HS256/384/512 and RS256/384/512 with JWKS (`oct` and `RSA` keys). Includes issuer/audience/leeway checks and in-memory JWKS caching with TTL.
- **API Key provider**: Added `RemoteApiKeyProvider` with configurable header name, remote verification, timeout, and positive/negative result caching.
- **OpenAPI-driven auth**: Default security providers are registered based on `components.securitySchemes` (e.g., API keys and Bearer/OAuth flows). API keys can be read from a named header or `Authorization: Bearer` fallback.
- **Metrics**: Added counters for top-level requests and authentication failures for visibility and alerting.


## üìà Performance Benchmarks (Sep 2025)

### BRRTRouters requests **‚âà 40 k req/s** 

| Stack / ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù benchmark          | Test rig(s)*                               | Req/s (steady-state) | Comments                                |

### Interpretation

* **40 k req/s** with JSON encode/parse on every call is respectable for a coroutine runtime that **doesn‚Äôt** use a thread-per-core model.
* The concept of a Hello World is not really possible with BRRTRouter, as you always have a complete controller/handler path. Tests against the health endpoint match Axum; however, this is not a valuable example.
* It is, however, ~4‚Äì6√ó slower than the fastest Rust HTTP frameworks that exploit per-core threads, `mio`/epoll, and pre-allocated arenas.
* Socket-level errors (`connect 555`, `read 38 307`) show the client saturated or the server closed connections under load ‚Äì this artificially deflates RPS a bit.

### Why BRRTRouter is currently a bit slower

| Factor                                                                                                                    | Impact |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **may_minihttp** does its own tiny HTTP parse; not as tuned as hyper/actix.                                               |        |
| Each request still goes through **MPSC** channel -> coroutine context switch -> `serde_json` parse even for small bodies. |        |
| Default coroutine **stack size** = 1 MB; 800 concurrent requests ‚áí 800 MB virtual memory ‚áí Œª minor kernel pressure.       |        |
| No **connection pooling / keep-alive tuning** yet.                                                                        |        |

## üî≠ Vision

Build the fastest, most predictable OpenAPI-native router in Rust ‚Äî capable of **millions of requests per second**, entirely spec-driven, and friendly to coroutine runtimes.

> We aim for **100K route match requests/sec on a single-core**, with sub-millisecond latency.  
> This excludes handler execution cost and assumes coroutine-friendly request handling.

| **Schema validation**                            | ‚úÖ      | Request and response validation against OpenAPI JSON Schema with clear 400 errors; exercised in tests.                                                                    |
| **Improved handler ergonomics**                  | ‚úÖ     | Use `#[handler]` to implement the `Handler` trait automatically. |
| **Fix flaky tests / deterministic startup**      | ‚úÖ     | Tests use a fixed sleep to wait for server readiness and cancel the coroutine abruptly.                                                                                   |
| **Investigate config context**                   | ‚úÖ     | A pragmatic way to pass Configuration across the entire code base, possibly with an immutable global config that is loaded at start time                                  |
| **Extend fake otel collector across all tests**  | üöß     | Fake OpenTelemetry collector is used in just tests, but not all tests utilize it.                                                                                         |
| **handler coroutine stack size**                 | üöß     | Coroutine stack size is set via `BRRTR_STACK_SIZE` env var, but not dynamically adjustable or measured.                                                                   |
| **implement tracing across entire codebase**     | üöß     | Tracing is implemented in some places, but not consistently across the entire codebase.                                                                                   |
| **Deep dive into OpenAPI spec**                  | üöß     | OpenAPI spec parsing is basic; does not handle all features like `callbacks` and other functions, produce GAP analysis in order to completely support OpenAPI 3.1.0 spec. |
| **Panic recovery for handlers**                  | üöß     | Un-typed handlers recover from panics using `catch_unwind`; typed handlers do not.                                                                                        |
| **Multiple security providers**                  | üöß     | Multiple providers are supported and auto-registered from OpenAPI schemes; per-route scheme enforcement is covered by tests. Full OpenAPI OR-of-AND combination semantics are tracked in PRD. |
| **Configurable stack size with instrumentation** | üöß     | Stack size comes from `BRRTR_STACK_SIZE` environment variable and is logged in metrics; no runtime API or used-stack metrics.                                             |
| **Hot reload on spec change**                    | üöß     | `hot_reload::watch_spec` rebuilds the `Router`, but the server doesn‚Äôt automatically update the dispatcher or routes.                                                     |
| **Code generation for typed handlers**           | üöß     | Implemented via templates generating `TryFrom<HandlerRequest>` impls.                                                                                                     |
| **Dynamic route registration**                   | üöß     | `Dispatcher::add_route` and `register_from_spec` allow runtime insertion; tests cover this.                                                                               |
| **Structured tracing / metrics / CORS**          | üöß     | Tracing and metrics middleware exist (with OTEL test support); CORS middleware returns default headers but is not configurable.                                           |
| **WebSocket support**                            | üöß     | Absent. Only SSE is available via `x-sse` flag.                                                                                                                           |
| **SPIFFE support**                               | üöß     | SPIFFE fetching of X.509 and JWT SVIDs, bundles and supports watch/stream updates.                                                                                        |
| **Performance target**                           | üöß     | Criterion benchmarks exist, but no explicit optimization work toward the 100k req/sec goal.                                                                                 |
| **Documentation & packaging**                    | üöß     | README and roadmap exist; crate not yet prepared for crates.io publication.                                                                                               |

## üß™ Try It

Run the coroutine server:

```bash
just start-petstore

curl -i -H "X-API-Key: test123" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Bella"}' "http://0.0.0.0:8080/pets"
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Server: M
Date: Sat, 27 Sep 2025 19:15:27 GMT
Content-Length: 31
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

> {"id":67890,"status":"success"}


curl http://localhost:8080/health
> { "status": "ok" }
```



Visit `http://localhost:8080/docs` to open the bundled Swagger UI powered by the
`/openapi.yaml` specification.

Troubleshooting `/docs`:
- If you launch from a different working directory, pass an explicit docs path: `--doc-dir examples/pet_store/doc`.
- The `just start-petstore` task already sets the correct `--doc-dir`.

### Environment Variables

BRRTRouter reads `BRRTR_STACK_SIZE` to determine the stack size for
coroutines. The value can be a decimal number or a hex string like `0x8000`.
If unset, the default stack size is `0x4000` bytes.

## üèó Building the Pet Store Example
Run:

```bash
just build-pet-store
```

Builds the Pet Store example; you can pass cargo flags after the task.

## üß™ Running Tests

```bash
just test
```

### üìà Measuring Coverage

Install [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov):

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
just coverage # runs `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under 80`
```

The command fails if total coverage drops below 80%.

## üê≥ Pet Store Docker Image

The `examples/pet_store` application can be packaged as a Docker image for
integration testing or deployment. A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are
included. Build and run the container with:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The Dockerfile automatically runs the `brrtrouter-gen` generator so the example
code is always up to date. The generated `doc` and `static_site` directories are
copied into the final image. The service listens on port `8080` and exposes the
`/health` endpoint for readiness checks.

- All HTTP verbs: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`
- Static and parameterized paths
- Deeply nested routes
- Handler resolution
- Fallbacks (404/500) for Unknown paths and fallback behavior

### üìä Running Benchmarks

```bash
just bench
```

This executes `cargo bench` using Criterion to measure routing throughput.

Recent profiling with `flamegraph` highlighted regex capture and `HashMap`
allocations as hotspots. Preallocating buffers in `Router::route` and
`path_to_regex` trimmed roughly 5% off benchmark times on the expanded
throughput suite.

### üî• Generating Flamegraphs

Install the `cargo-flamegraph` subcommand by adding it as a development
dependency:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
flamegraph = "0.6"
```

Run the profiler against the pet store example:

```bash
just flamegraph
```

The command produces `flamegraph.svg` in `target/flamegraphs/`. Open the file in
your browser to inspect hot code paths.
See [docs/flamegraph.md](docs/flamegraph.md) for tips on reading the output.




## üîß Handler Registration Example

```rust
use brrrouter::dispatcher::{Dispatcher, echo_handler};

let mut dispatcher = Dispatcher::new();

unsafe {
dispatcher.register_handler("list_pets", echo_handler);
dispatcher.register_handler("get_user", echo_handler);
dispatcher.register_handler("post_item", echo_handler);
}
```

Each handler runs in its own coroutine, receiving requests via a channel and sending back structured HandlerResponse.

### Using `#[handler]`

Controllers can derive the `Handler` trait automatically with the procedural macro:

```rust
use brrtrouter_macros::handler;
use brrtrouter::typed::TypedHandlerRequest;

#[handler(MyController)]
pub fn handle(req: TypedHandlerRequest<MyRequest>) -> MyResponse {
    // ...
}
```

---
## üîå Middleware

Middlewares run before and after each handler. Register them on the dispatcher:

```rust
use brrrouter::middleware::{
    AuthMiddleware, CorsMiddleware, MetricsMiddleware, TracingMiddleware,
};
use std::sync::Arc;

let mut dispatcher = Dispatcher::new();
dispatcher.add_middleware(Arc::new(MetricsMiddleware::new()));
dispatcher.add_middleware(Arc::new(TracingMiddleware));
dispatcher.add_middleware(Arc::new(AuthMiddleware::new("Bearer secret".into())));
dispatcher.add_middleware(Arc::new(CorsMiddleware));
```

`MetricsMiddleware` tracks request counts and average latency. `TracingMiddleware`
creates spans for each request, and `CorsMiddleware` adds CORS headers to responses.

Note: `AuthMiddleware` in examples is development-only. Prefer OpenAPI-driven `SecurityProvider`s (`BearerJwtProvider`, `OAuth2Provider`, `JwksBearerProvider`, `RemoteApiKeyProvider`) for production authentication.

---
## üîê Security & Authentication

BRRTRouter provides a pluggable `SecurityProvider` abstraction and auto-registers providers from your OpenAPI `components.securitySchemes`.

- **Bearer (mock/JWT)**: `BearerJwtProvider` validates simple dot-separated tokens and checks whitespace-separated `scope` claims; supports header and cookie extraction.
- **OAuth2 (mock)**: `OAuth2Provider` mirrors Bearer validation while matching OAuth2 schemes declared in OpenAPI.
- **JWKS (production)**: `JwksBearerProvider` fetches keys from a JWKS URL and validates JWTs using the token header algorithm. Supported: HS256/384/512 and RS256/384/512. Includes issuer/audience checking, exp with leeway, and TTL-based JWKS caching.
- **Remote API Keys**: `RemoteApiKeyProvider` verifies API keys via an HTTP endpoint, with configurable header name, timeout, and result caching. Also accepts `Authorization: Bearer <key>` fallback.

Config:

```yaml
security:
  # Global PropelAuth config (preferred)
  propelauth:
    auth_url: "https://auth.example.com"
    audience: "my-audience"
    # issuer, jwks_url, leeway_secs, cache_ttl_secs are optional; derived when omitted

  # Per-scheme JWKS (if not using PropelAuth)
  jwks:
    BearerAuth:
      jwks_url: "https://issuer.example/.well-known/jwks.json"
      iss: "https://issuer.example/"
      aud: "my-audience"
      leeway_secs: 30
      cache_ttl_secs: 300

  # Remote API key verification
  remote_api_keys:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      verify_url: "https://auth.example/verify"
      header_name: "X-API-Key"
      timeout_ms: 500
      cache_ttl_secs: 60
```

Manual provider wiring has been intentionally omitted; configure providers via YAML.

Authentication failures are tracked by `MetricsMiddleware` counters for observability.

Auto-registration from OpenAPI and config

- Providers are bound automatically from `components.securitySchemes` at startup.
- You can override or configure providers via `config/config.yaml` in generated apps. See `templates/config.yaml` for all available options (PropelAuth JWKS, per-scheme JWKS, static/remote API keys, cookie names, leeway/TTL).

TODO

- Add an optional CI workflow to validate against a real PropelAuth sandbox using repository secrets (auth_url, audience). Keep disabled by default to avoid external flakiness; primary tests remain hermetic with local JWKS/API-key mocks.

## üì° Server-Sent Events

BRRTRouter can serve [Server-Sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html).
Mark a `GET` operation in your OpenAPI spec with the custom `x-sse: true` extension and
return `text/event-stream` content. Handlers use `brrrouter::sse::channel()` to emit events.
See [`examples/openapi.yaml`](examples/openapi.yaml) for the sample `/events` endpoint.
