## BRRTRouter Integration Status

### Current State

**Vendored Patch**:
- ‚úÖ Currently using vendored `may_minihttp` with `MAX_HEADERS = 128`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vendor directory causes build issues (removed vendoring config)
- üîÑ Need to switch to fork via git dependency

**Next Steps**:
1. [ ] Remove vendor directory
2. [ ] Update Cargo.toml to use fork
3. [ ] Test build
4. [ ] Verify no TooManyHeaders errors

### After Upstream Merge

Once `may_minihttp` PR is merged:

```toml
# Cargo.toml - revert to upstream
[dependencies]
may_minihttp = "0.1.12"  # or whatever version includes fix
```

## Communication Plan

### Before Submitting PRs

- [ ] Review both codebases thoroughly
- [ ] Check existing issues/PRs for similar requests
- [ ] Prepare benchmarks/evidence
- [ ] Write clear, professional PR descriptions

### During Review

- [ ] Respond promptly to feedback
- [ ] Be flexible on implementation details
- [ ] Provide additional data if requested
- [ ] Keep PRs focused and minimal

### If PRs are Rejected

**Plan A**: Maintain our forks
- Document fork maintenance process
- Set up automated sync with upstream
- Regularly rebase on upstream changes
- Consider becoming maintainer

**Plan B**: Switch HTTP libraries
- Evaluate `hyper` (100 header default)
- Evaluate `actix-web` (32 header default)
- Major refactor but clean solution

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Success ‚úÖ
- [x] Identified root cause (httparse via may_minihttp)
- [x] Implemented workaround (vendored patch)
- [x] Documented solution
- [ ] Created forks with fixes
- [ ] BRRTRouter using forks (no TooManyHeaders errors)

### Target Success üéØ
- [ ] httparse docs PR merged
- [ ] may_minihttp PR merged
- [ ] BRRTRouter using upstream versions
- [ ] No TooManyHeaders errors in production

### Stretch Success üöÄ
- [ ] Become trusted contributor to may_minihttp
- [ ] Help improve httparse ergonomics
- [ ] Present findings at Rust meetup
- [ ] Blog post about debugging process

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Systematic investigation (vendor/ inspection)
- Clear documentation of findings
- Temporary workaround while pursuing upstream fix
- Preparing detailed PR plan before submitting

### What Could Be Better
- Should have checked upstream earlier
- Could have reached out to maintainers first
- Vendoring all dependencies caused issues

### For Future Reference
- Always check if issue is in dependencies first
- Document investigation process thoroughly
- Have a rollback plan before making changes
- Community contributions benefit everyone
