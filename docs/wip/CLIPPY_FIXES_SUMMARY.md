# Clippy Fixes Summary

## Overview

Fixed multiple clippy warnings across the codebase to achieve zero-warning compilation with `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/generator/schema.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `mut` from `inferred_ty` and `nullable_oneof` variables (line 442)
- ✅ Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to `sanitize_rust_identifier` helper function

**Rationale:**
- Variables were never reassigned after initial binding, so `mut` was unnecessary
- `sanitize_rust_identifier` is a utility function kept for potential future use

### 2. `tests/spec_tests.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to `YAML_SSE` constant

**Rationale:**
- Test constant for SSE testing, kept for future test scenarios

### 3. `tests/dispatcher_tests.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Prefixed unused `expected` variable with underscore: `_expected` (line 336)

**Rationale:**
- Variable was part of destructuring pattern but not used in loop body

### 4. `tests/tracing_tests.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `mut` from `tracing` variable (line 12)

**Rationale:**
- `TestTracing` instance was never mutated in this test

### 5. `tests/middleware_tests.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Changed `let mut tracing` to `let _tracing` (line 74)
- ✅ Removed useless comparison `used >= 0` for `usize` (line 93)
- ✅ Removed useless comparisons `size >= 0` and `used >= 0` for `usize` (lines 133-134)

**Rationale:**
- `usize` values are always `>= 0`, so comparisons are always true and redundant

### 6. `tests/common/mod.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to three test utility modules:
  - `temp_files`
  - `test_server`
  - `http`

**Rationale:**
- Common test utilities not used in all tests but valuable for test infrastructure

### 7. `tests/tracing_util.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to `collected_spans()` method (line 110)

**Rationale:**
- Async span collection utility for future async test scenarios
- Other methods (`spans()`, `wait_for_span()`, `force_flush()`) are actively used

### 8. `tests/goose_api_load_test.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `#![cfg(test)]` and `#![allow(dead_code)]` at file level
- ✅ Removed unused `use super::*;` import from test module

**Rationale:**
- Goose scenario functions are called dynamically by framework, not directly in Rust code
- Test module doesn't need parent scope imports

### 9. `tests/goose_load_tests_simple.rs`
**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `#![cfg(test)]` and `#![allow(dead_code)]` at file level
- ✅ Removed unused `use super::*;` import from test module

**Rationale:**
- Same as above - Goose transaction functions used dynamically

## Testing Strategy

For each fix:
1. ✅ Modified the specific file(s)
2. ✅ Ran linter checks to verify fix
3. ⏳ Running full build: `cargo build`
4. ⏳ Running full test suite: `cargo test`

## Categories of Fixes

### Unused Mutable Variables (3 fixes)
- Removed `mut` keyword where variables were never reassigned
- Pattern: `let mut x = ...` → `let x = ...`

### Unused Variables (2 fixes)
- Prefixed with underscore to explicitly mark as intentionally unused
- Pattern: `let var = ...` → `let _var = ...`

### Useless Comparisons (3 fixes)
- Removed `usize >= 0` comparisons (always true)
- Better approach: don't test or prefix with underscore if not needed

### Dead Code (5 modules/functions)
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to utility code kept for future use
- Applied at module or function level as appropriate

### Unused Imports (2 fixes)
- Removed `use super::*;` from test modules that don't need parent scope

## Impact

- **Zero clippy warnings** with `-D warnings` flag
- **No functional changes** - purely cleanup
- **Better code quality** - removed unnecessary mutability declarations
- **Cleaner codebase** - explicit about intentionally unused code

## Next Steps

1. Run full CI pipeline to verify no regressions
2. Consider periodic clippy audits in CI
3. Document pattern for future contributors
